## The Power of Utility Classes

Tailwind CSS has completely changed how I write CSS. Instead of fighting with class names and specificity wars, I can just compose utilities to build complex interfaces.

```css
.btn {
  @apply px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded;
}
```

It's fast, flexible, and completely customizable.
