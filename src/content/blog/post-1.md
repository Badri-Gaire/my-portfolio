## Introduction

Astro is an amazing web framework for building content-driven websites. It allows you to build your UI with your favorite JavaScript component framework (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.) and renders your site to static HTML during build time.

## Why Astro?

*   **Zero JS by default**: Astro renders HTML on the server and strips away any remaining, unused JavaScript.
*   **Islands Architecture**: Generate static HTML for your page, then hydrate dynamic components only when they are needed.

I'm loving it so far!
